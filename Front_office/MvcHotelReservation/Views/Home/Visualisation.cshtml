            <h2>Deluxe Room</h2>
            <p>
                A Deluxe Room is a step above the standard hotel room, offering more space, better furnishings, and a touch of elegance. These rooms are designed to cater to travelers who seek additional comfort and style without opting for a full suite. Deluxe rooms often feature a larger bed, such as a queen or king size, with premium bedding and pillows. The decor is typically modern, with tasteful accents, large windows, and ambient lighting to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.

                The en-suite bathroom in a deluxe room is often upgraded, including a spacious shower, a luxurious bathtub, and premium toiletries. Additional amenities include a larger flat-screen TV, a work desk with ergonomic seating, and a well-stocked minibar. Many deluxe rooms also provide access to premium facilities such as fitness centers, spa services, or executive lounges. This room type is perfect for couples, business travelers, or guests looking to enhance their stay with extra luxury and comfort.
